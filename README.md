# hyprdrover

hyprdrover is a lightweight session manager for the Hyprland compositor. It allows users to snapshot their current window layout (workspaces, positions, and sizes) and restore it later. This is particularly useful for saving specific workflows and quickly switching between them.

## Features

-   **Session Snapshot**: Captures the state of all active windows, including their workspace, position, size, and monitor.
-   **Session Restoration**: Restores windows to their saved positions and workspaces.
-   **Application Launching**: Automatically attempts to launch applications that are missing from the current session during restoration.
-   **Smart Filtering**: Automatically ignores system overlays and background utilities (e.g., Rofi, Waybar, Dunst).
-   **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interface for saving, loading, and listing sessions.
-   **JSON Storage**: Sessions are saved as human-readable JSON files.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Rust (latest stable toolchain)
-   Hyprland
-   `hyprctl` (usually comes with Hyprland)

### Building from Source

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/S-Sigdel/hyprDrover.git
    cd hyprDrover
    ```

2.  Build the project:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

3.  Install the binary:
    You can use the built-in install command to copy the binary to `~/.local/bin/`:
    ```bash
    ./target/release/hyprdrover --install
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can manually move it:
    ```bash
    sudo cp target/release/hyprdrover /usr/local/bin/
    ```

### From AUR
1. You can also use aur helper like yay to install this package from Arch User Repository:
    ```bash
    yay -S hyprdrover
    ```
## Usage

hyprdrover is controlled entirely via the command line.

### Save a Session

To snapshot the current state of your Hyprland session:

```bash
hyprdrover --save
```

This will create a new JSON file in `~/.config/hyprdrover/sessions/` with a timestamp.

You can also give the session a name:

```bash
hyprdrover --save my-workflow
```

This will save the session as `my-workflow.json`.

### List Saved Sessions

To view all available snapshots:

```bash
hyprdrover --list
```

### Restore a Session

To restore the most recent session:

```bash
hyprdrover --load
```

To restore a specific named session:

```bash
hyprdrover --load my-workflow
```

To restore a specific session file by path:

```bash
hyprdrover --load ~/.config/hyprdrover/sessions/session_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json
```

### Install

To install the binary to your local bin directory (`~/.local/bin`):

```bash
hyprdrover --install
```

## Configuration

Currently, configuration is handled via defaults. The application automatically ignores the following window classes to prevent issues during restoration:

-   `rofi`
-   `waybar`
-   `dunst`
-   `hyprland-share-picker`
-   `polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1`
